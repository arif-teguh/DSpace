Therefore, finding other xenofree materials as FBS alternative in cryopreservation medium is very important. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is albumin rich and is a candidate for FBS alternative as cryopreservation supplement. Albumin is a natural extracellular cryoprotective agent that stabilizes impaired cell membrane during cryopreservation. This was an in vitro analytical study to to compare the effect of PRP and FBS as supplement in cryopreservation medium on human umbilical cord stem cells. In this study the stem cells were isolated from an umbilical cord tissue by explant method and propagated untill we got enough cells for cryopreservation. Cryopreservations were done using eight types of protocol, which differed in type and concentration of supplement and cell concentration. The effect of the eight protocols were compared in terms of post cryopreservation cell viability, morphology, cell size and proliferation. There were no difference between FBS and PRP supplemented cryopreservation media in term of cell viability and morphology. PRP supplemented medium showed better post cryopreservation performance in cell size and proliferation.

Mangiferin (MGR), a naturally occurring glucosylxanthone, has antioxidant and cardioprotective properties. However, its cardioprotection mechanism has yet to be revealed.||OBJECTIVE: This study determines whether the cardioprotective effect of MGR is caused by its effect on intracellular calcium regulation.||MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced by DOX intraperitoneally with a total dose of 15 mg/kg bw. MGR was given orally at the doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg bw/d for seven consecutive weeks. The parameters examined were mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene (TNF-α), calcium regulatory gene (SERCA2a) and proapoptotic genes (caspase-9 and caspase-12), as well as cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels.||RESULTS: Treatment with MGR at 60 mg/kg bw/d significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α by 44.55% and caspase-9 by 52.79%, as well as the cytosolic calcium level by 24.15% (p < 0.05). SERCA2a and caspase-12 expressions were only slightly affected (27.27% increase and 24.85% decrease for SERCA2a and caspase-12, respectively, p > 0.05). Meanwhile, MGR 30 mg/kg bw/d gave insignificant results in all parameters.||DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: MGR protected against DOX-induced cardiac inflammation and apoptosis via down-regulation of proapoptotic and proinflammatory gene expressions, upregulation of SERCA2a gene expression, and normalization of cytosolic calcium level. Thus, the cardioprotective effect of MGR is at least in part due to the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.",Pharmaceutical Biology,2016,10.3109/13880209.2015.1073750,1388-0209,Apoptosis||SERCA2a||Cardiotoxicity||Inflammation,en,Journal Article,54,7,1289-1297,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2015.1073750

In Vietnam, despite a first report on PvCQR published in the early 2000s, P.vivax was still considered sensitive to CQ. Between May 2009 and December 2011, a 2-year cohort study was conducted in Central Vietnam to assess the recommended radical cure regimen based on a 10-day course Primaquine (0.5mg/kg/day) together with 3 days CQ (25mg/kg). We hereby report the results of the first 28-day follow-up estimating the cumulative risk of P. vivax recurrences together with the corresponding CQ blood concentrations among other endpoints. Out of 260 recruited P.vivax patients, 240 completed treatment and were followed up to day 28 according to the WHO guidelines. Eight patients (3.45%) had a P.vivax recurrent infection, at day 14 (n=2), day 21 (n=1) and day 28 (n=5). Chloroquine blood concentrations, available in 3/8 recurrent infections (day 14,21,28) were above the minimal inhibitory concentration (>100ng/ml whole blood) in all of them. Fever and parasitaemia (both sexual and asexual stages) were cleared by day 3. Anemia was common at day 0 (35.8%) especially in children below 10 (50%) and hemoglobin (Hb) recovery at day 28 was substantial among anemic patients (median change d28-d0 =+1.7g/dl; IQR[+0.7; +3.2]). This report, based on CQ blood levels measured at the time of recurrences, confirms for the first time P. vivax CQ resistance in Central Vietnam, and calls for further studies using standardized protocols for accurately monitoring the extent and evolution of PvCQR in Vietnam.

Experimental diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (55 mg/kg), and curcumin was given at 100 mg/kg by gavage for 56 days. We observed that curcumin improved the morphological and histopathological changes, significantly decreased hepatic ERS marker protein: glucose-regulated protein 78, and improved liver function in diabetic rats. Moreover, treatment with curcumin markedly decreased the sub-arm of the UPR signaling protein such as phospho-double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2, and inositol-requiring enzyme1α; and inhibited tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 in liver tissues of diabetic rats. Apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling proteins, such as cleaved caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma 2, were significantly increased and decreased, respectively in diabetic rats; curcumin treatment prevented all of these alterations. In summary, our results indicate that curcumin has the potential to protect the diabetic liver by modulating hepatic ERS-mediated apoptosis, and provides a novel therapeutic strategy for the diabetic liver damage.",Free Radical Research,2015,10.3109/10715762.2014.999674,1029-2470,Apoptosis||Curcumin||Diabetes Mellitus||Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress||Liver,en,Journal Article,49,3,279-289,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4389763/

The immunoreactivity of CaMKI β 2 was detected in the earliest development of the primordial retina at embryological day (E) 12. The inner neuroblastic layer from which the presumptive ganglion cells are generated showed the ubiquitous CaMKI β 2 immunoreactivity at E15 and persistently expressed at the same level until postnatal day (P) 0 when the inner neuroblastic layer divides into the ganglionic cell layer and the inner plexiform layer. The strong immunoreactivity was detected in the ganglion cell layer and the moderate one in the internal plexiform layer. CaMKI β 2 immunoreactivities were persistantly expressed throughout the postnatal development at the same level. The low level of intensity was first found in the inner nuclear layer at P7, followed by the outer plexiform, outer nuclear and rod - cone cell layers at the age of P12, respectively. The intensit ies of CaMKI β 2 immunoreactivities in the inner nuclear and ro d - cone cell layers were gradually increased to the strong level by P18 and persisted until adulthood. The present study revealed that the expression of CaMKI β 2 in the retina was detected from the earliest development until adulthood, indicating that CaMKI β 2 may be required in both proliferation and differentiation of the retinal precursor cells and subsequent formation of the functional layers.

Optimal acquisition of photographic data requires a dedicated photography studio or a three-dimensional anatomic scanner, both of which are financially impractical for most clinicians. Simplified photo standardization is proposed for use in random clinical settings by using a portable device called the Mirror Stand (MirS). This model device aims to mimic a studio environment by incorporating the basic elements of producing consistent photographs. The pilot MirS is designed for facial photography. Images of 40 random subjects were obtained using the MirS with three different cameras. Real anthropometric measurements of each subject were collected, compared with the photographic measurements, and analyzed. In this study, all three cameras produced equally reliable measurements. Actual facial measurements were comparable to the photogrammetric measurements obtained from photographs taken using the MirS. A constant formula was derived; it allowed the conversion of photographic values into real anthropometric values. The MirS produced consistent photographs with respect to the measurements. The photographs obtained could be translated reliably into their real anthropometric measurements. Therefore, the MirS can be applied in daily practice, providing an efficient alternative for obtaining a standard justifiable photograph.",Archives of Plastic Surgery,2015,10.5999/aps.2015.42.3.356,2234-6163,Anthropometry||Cephalometry||Photogrammetry||Plastic Surgery,en,Journal Article,42,3,356-360,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439598/

As children are expected to survive well into adulthood, understanding childhood as well as potential future cardiovascular complications is of major importance.||METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed published literature on childhood cardiac manifestations and longer term effects of pediatric HIV infection on the cardiovascular system. Evidence gaps that should be prioritized in research are highlighted. Through poorly understood mechanisms, HIV infection may cause various cardiac complications already manifesting in childhood, such as structural and functional myocardial derangements, pulmonary hypertension, pericardial effusion and possibly endocarditis. Evidence indicates that HIV infection in children also has unfavorable effects on the vasculature and cardiovascular biomarkers, such as increased intima-media thickness and decreased flow-mediated dilation, a marker of endothelial function. However, studies are small and predominantly include antiretroviral therapy-treated children, so that it is difficult to differentiate between effects of HIV infection per se and antiretroviral therapy treatment, reported in adults to have cardiovascular side effects.||CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection in children may greatly impact the cardiovascular system, including effects on the heart, which tend to manifest early in childhood, and on the vasculature. The underlying mechanisms, essential for targeted prevention, are poorly understood. Current evidence largely stems from research in adults. However, as modes of infection, immune maturity, growth and development, and treatment are markedly different in children, specific pediatric research, accounting for the complex interplay of normal growth and development, HIV infection and treatment, is clearly warranted.",European Journal of Preventive Cardiology,2014,10.1177/2047487314560086,2047-4873,Human Immunodeficiency Virus||Atherosclerosis||Cardiovascular|Children||Heart,en,Journal Article,22,11,1452-1461,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2047487314560086?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#articleCitationDownloadContainer

It has not been well established whether this therapy provides additional effects when combined with vitamin D or its analog in a model of adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy.||Methods: We evaluated the effect of an angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor blocker (telmisartan) combined with a vitamin D analog (oxacalcitriol) on mice ADR-induced nephropathy (9.5 mg/kg single intravenous injection). We also tested immortalized murine podocytes to examine the effects on podocyte apoptosis.||Results: Mice with ADR-induced nephropathy developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis within 30 days accompanied by decreased expression of slit diaphragm (SD)-associated proteins (nephrin and podocin), reduced numbers of podocytes, and increased systolic blood pressure. Treatment with telmisartan or oxacalcitriol alone moderately ameliorated kidney injury. The combined treatment most effectively reduced the albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis. These effects were accompanied by the restoration of SD-associated proteins, reduction of podocyte apoptosis, and prevention of podocyte depletion in the glomeruli. Treatment with telmisartan, oxacalcitriol, and the combination therapy resulted in similar reductions in systolic blood pressure. In cultured murine podocytes, ADR stimulated the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and apoptosis as determined by Hoechst 33342 staining. These changes were effectively inhibited by telmisartan or oxacalcitriol, but the combination treatment most effectively reduced these effects.||Conclusions: These data demonstrated that application of a renin-angiotensin system blocker plus a vitamin D analog effectively prevented renal injury in ADR-induced nephropathy.

However, NAFLD remains undiagnosed in most people with limited access to imaging facilities in most developing countries.||OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of NAFLD and to develop the risk scoring model for predicting the presence of NAFLD among adult medical check-up patients.||METHOD: A large prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among medical check-up patients who underwent transabdominal ultrasound examination between January and December 2013 in Medistra Hospital, Jakarta. Data were obtained from the patients' medical records. Logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify the best combination of risk factors for predicting fatty liver using the backward (likelihood ratio) approach. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were estimated using the logistic regression coefficient. The prediction model was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and was validated on a new, prospective cohort. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.||RESULTS: A total of 1,054 cases was included in this study. Fatty liver was present in 538 (51.0%) patients. Bivariate analyses found associations among fatty liver and several risk factors. Six risk factors were incorporated to build the final prediction model. All scores were summed up to obtain the total score. A probability equation was developed by applying linear regression analysis on the total score. The prediction model had good diagnostic performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =0.833 (95% confidence interval =0.809-0.857). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit P-value was 0.232, which indicated the appropriateness of the logistic regression model to predict fatty liver. On the validation set, the scoring system proved to be moderately accurate and can potentially be applied to larger population setting.||CONCLUSION: The presence of fatty liver in NAFLD patients can be predicted using our proposed fatty liver scoring system.","Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity : Targets and Therapy",2015,10.2147/DMSO.S80364,1178-7007,Fatty Liver||Scoring Model||Ultrasound||Community||Developing Countries||Diagnostic Performance,en,Journal Article,8,,213-218,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4410820/#

Patients of functional Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II-IV, despite stable and optimal medical management, with documented myocardial segments with reversible ischemia and/or hibernation on the basis of echocardiography/single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) were enrolled from 2010 to 2012. A total of 111 patients were enrolled, 33 from Indonesia, 21 from Malaysia, and 57 from Philippines. Patients underwent nine cycles of ESMT over 9 weeks. Patients were followed up for 3-6 months after ESMT treatment. During follow-up, patients were subjected to clinical evaluation, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, assessment of nitrate intake, the 6-min walk test, echocardiography, and SPECT.||Results: The mean age of the population was 62.9±10.9 years. The summed difference score on pharmacologically induced stress SPECT improved from 9.53±17.87 at baseline to 7.77±11.83 at follow-up (P=0.0086). Improvement in the total Seattle Angina Questionnaire score was seen in 83% of patients (P<0.0001). Sublingual nitroglycerin use significantly decreased (1.14±1.01 tablets per week at baseline to 0.52±0.68 tablets per week at follow-up; P=0.0215).

However, information about its burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is scant. We thus set out to review both published and unpublished information on the presentation, causes, management, and outcomes of heart failure in LMICs.||Methods and Findings: Medline, Embase, Global Health Database, and World Health Organization regional databases were searched for studies from LMICs published between 1 January 1995 and 30 March 2014. Additional unpublished data were requested from investigators and international heart failure experts. We identified 42 studies that provided relevant information on acute hospital care (25 LMICs; 232,550 patients) and 11 studies on the management of chronic heart failure in primary care or outpatient settings (14 LMICs; 5,358 patients). The mean age of patients studied ranged from 42 y in Cameroon and Ghana to 75 y in Argentina, and mean age in studies largely correlated with the human development index of the country in which they were conducted (r= 0.71, p,0.001). Overall, ischaemic heart disease was the main reported cause of heart failure in all regions except Africa and the Americas, where hypertension was predominant. Taking both those managed acutely in hospital and those in nonacute outpatient or community settings together, 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49%–64%) of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 34% (95% CI: 28%–41%) with beta-blockers, and 32% (95% CI: 25%–39%) with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Mean inpatient stay was 10 d, ranging from 3 d in India to 23 d in China. Acute heart failure accounted for 2.2% (range: 0.3%–7.7%) of total hospital admissions, and mean in-hospitalmortalitywas 8% (95% CI: 6%–10%). There was substantial variation between studies (p,0.001 across all variables), and most data were from urban tertiary referral centres. Only one population-based study assessing incidence and/or prevalence of heart failure was identified.||Conclusions: The presentation, underlying causes, management, and outcomes of heart failure vary substantially across LMICs. On average, the use of evidence-based medications tends to be suboptimal. Better strategies for heart failure surveillance and management in LMICs are needed.",PLoS Medicine,2014,10.1371/journal.pmed.1001699,1549-1676,,en,Journal Article,11,8,e1001699,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130667/

The aim of this work was to design, to synthesize, and to evaluate the novel open-chain analogues of antimycin A3 as highly potent anti-colorectal cancer agents.||Methods: Our analogue synthesis was designed by modifying the nine-membered dilactone moiety of antimycin A3 with a simple open-chain moiety, as well as introducing the stereocenter, and the hydroxyl groups on the side chain of the ester group. The synthesis was conducted through a sequence of reactions from Boc-L-threonine by esterification, amidation, and sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. After completion the synthesis, cytotoxicities of the analogues were evaluated as inhibitors of colorectal HCT-116 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell proliferation assay.||Results: Novel open-chain analogues of antimycin A3 were successfully synthesized in a good yield. The analogues exhibited a greater anticancer activity against colorectal HCT-116 cells than the original antimycin A3 with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging of 35.0-47.0 μM. The results indicated that the presence of stereocenter and a hydroxylated open-chain moiety in the analogues were successfully improved its anti-colorectal cancer activity.||Conclusion: Our results clearly demonstrate that the opened-chain analogues of antimycin A3 as a promising candidates of new anti-colorectal cancer agents.",Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research,2015,,0974-2441,Design||Synthesis||Open-Chain||Analogue||Antimycin A3||Anti-Colorectal Cancer,en,Journal Article,8,6,120-124,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f587/530e1cdbf2035c67fc652a4f906139190b88.pdf?_ga=2.147955255.1853306354.1560304497-1438260571.1559016593

The current standard therapy is a combination of pegylated interferon-α plus ribavirin with NS3 protease inhibitors. Addition of NS3 protease inhibitors increases response rates; however, this addition is associated with significant side effects and an increase in the overall cost of the treatment. Therefore, there remains a need to develop safe and inexpensive drugs for the treatment of HCV infections. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of a crude extract from Dimocarpuslongan leaves against HCV (genotype 2a strain JFH1). The D. longan crude extract exhibited anti-HCV activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 19.4 μg/ml without cytotoxicity. A time-of-addition study demonstrated that the crude extract exerts anti-HCV activity at both the entry and post-entry steps. The crude extract markedly blocked viral entry step through a direct virucidal effect with a marginal inhibition of virion assembly. The co-treatment of the crude extract with cyclosporine A or telaprevir, an NS3 protease inhibitor, had additive and synergistic antiviral effects, respectively. Our findings suggest that the D. longan crude extract may be a candidate of the add-on therapy for HCV infection.",Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases,2016,10.7883/yoken.JJID.2015.10,1344-6304,Hepatitis C Virus||Antiviral||Crude Extract of Dimocarpus Longan Leaves,en,Journal Article,69,3,213-220,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/69/3/69_JJID.2015.107/_article
